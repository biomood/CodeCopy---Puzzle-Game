CODE COPY

INTRODUCTION
Code Copy is a simple puzzle game in lua using Love2D. You are represented with a block pattern at the start of each level, the goal is to reproduce the pattern in the level by firing a shot that will either set a block or remove a block.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (dingux)
You will need the nLove framework for dingux. CodeCopy assumes that nlove is placed under /local/nlove. The CodeCopy.love package should be under /local/nlove/games.
Create a bash script to load the game. If you place the nlove and the codecopy package as above then the bash script will be:

'#!/bin/sh
/boot/local/nlove/nlove.dge /boot/local/nlove/games/CodeCopy.love'

If you are using gmenu2x this can be added as a link
